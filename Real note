# Notes

A quiet starting point.  
Using this space to learn GitHub and map my ideas one step at a time.

## Thoughts
- Keep it simple while I get used to the platform
- Build slowly and intentionally
- Let this repo grow with me

## Next Steps
- Update the README with a clearer purpose
- Add more notes as ideas come
- Decide what this project will eventually become
